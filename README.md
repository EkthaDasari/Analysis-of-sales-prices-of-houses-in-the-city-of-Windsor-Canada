# Analysis-of-sales-prices-of-houses-in-the-city-of-Windsor-Canada

House prices vary from one type of house to another and from one place to another over period of time. It is because of this predicament a system that predicts the price of a house based on different factors needs to be developed. The method developed in this project is a basic method based on linear regresison which helps people who are looking to buy a house by analysing various elements of the property. The following report is based on the dataset “House Prices in the City of Windsor, Canada”, obtained from the website "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html" which contains data related to sales prices of the houses which were sold in Windsor city, Canada during the year 1987 in the months July, August and September.
